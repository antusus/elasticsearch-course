##Document
 - Something you are search in for in ES
 - Must have ID that you provide or make ES to generate for you

##Indices
 - The Highest level entity that you can query
 - Can return list of documents that you were querying for
 - Indices are inverted, in short they keep terms (elements of documents) with reference to document they appear in

##Relevance
 - **TF-IDF** - means Term Frequency * Inverse Document Frequency
 - **Term Frequency** - describes how often a term appears in _a given document_
 - **Document Frequency** - describes how often term appears in _all documents_
 - **Term Frequency / Document Frequency** - measures relevance of a term in a document
